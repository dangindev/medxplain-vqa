While there appears to be some variation in cellular density within the infiltrate, there is no distinct pattern or organization suggesting granulomas or other specific structures.  The overlying epidermis shows mild hyperkeratosis.  Further workup, including special stains and possibly clinical correlation, would be needed for a definitive diagnosis.\n",
