The central area shows a dense collection of cells with relatively uniform, small, round nuclei, suggestive of a lymphoid infiltrate.  The surrounding tissue appears to be connective tissue.  Without further clinical information or additional staining, a definitive diagnosis is not possible, but the appearance is compatible with a lymphoid aggregate or a small lymphocytic lymphoma.  This is certainly not a PET or bone scan image.\n",
