Image A shows the external surface, while Image B displays the opened esophageal lumen, revealing the mucosal surface. Image C shows a microscopic view of the esophageal wall.  The mucosal surface in Images A and B appears unremarkable without obvious lesions.  In the microscopic image (C), the esophageal mucosa, submucosa, and a portion of the muscularis propria are visible. The tissue appears normal with stratified squamous epithelium, underlying submucosal glands, and organized smooth muscle.  Without further clinical information or higher magnification of the microscopic image, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made.\n",
