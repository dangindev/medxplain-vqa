  "unified_answer": "This image appears to show a segment of rib with an expansile,  pale tan-white lesion.  The lesion disrupts the normal cortical bone and appears to involve the medullary cavity.  Surrounding soft tissue appears hemorrhagic.  Without further clinical information and microscopic examination, a definitive diagnosis is impossible. However, the differential diagnosis should include benign and malignant bone tumors, such as fibrous dysplasia, enchondroma, osteosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma, as well as other lesions like giant cell tumor and aneurysmal bone cyst.  Infection (osteomyelitis) should also be considered.\n",
