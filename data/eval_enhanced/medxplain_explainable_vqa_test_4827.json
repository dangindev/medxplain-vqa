While the image suggests the presence of vertebral bodies and ribs, the resolution and clarity are insufficient to definitively identify individual bone-to-bone articulations or their associated features such as joint spaces or articular surfaces.  Therefore, while vertebral and costovertebral joints are likely present given the anatomical structures visualized, they cannot be conclusively identified or characterized based on this image alone.\n",

Consider the image resolution and clarity when evaluating for the presence of joint spaces, articular surfaces, and any associated anatomical landmarks (e.g.,  epiphyses, metaphyses if applicable) within these regions.  Describe the location and characteristics of any identified joints. If no joints are clearly visible, explain why based on the image content and quality.?",
