Specifically, examine the middle center region and the secondary attention region for evidence of glands such as the thyroid, parathyroid, pituitary, pineal, adrenal glands, pancreas, or gonads (if applicable based on the imaged anatomy).  Consider the image resolution and any artifacts that may obscure visualization of these structures.  Describe the location of any potential endocrine structures relative to other anatomical landmarks visible in the image.  Evaluation criteria include the shape, size, and texture of potential endocrine structures compared to their expected appearance in medical imaging. If no clear endocrine structures are visible, explain why based on the image content and quality.?",
