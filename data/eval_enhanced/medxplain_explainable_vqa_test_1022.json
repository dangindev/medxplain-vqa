Consider image quality and resolution when evaluating.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Including secondary attention region and landmarks):**\n\n\"Focusing on the upper central region of this 224x224 image, and also considering the secondary region of interest [describe location of secondary region relative to a landmark, e.g., \"inferior to the clavicle\"], is a clear example of [target anatomical structure] present?  Assess the visibility and definition of the structure, taking into account the image resolution and any potential artifacts.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Emphasis on diagnostic quality):**\n\n\"Is this 224x224 image of sufficient quality to clearly visualize a representative example of [target anatomical structure] in the primary region of interest (upper center)?  Specifically, evaluate the definition and clarity of the [target anatomical structure] in this region, and also consider its appearance in the secondary region [describe location],  taking into account potential limitations in resolution or the presence of artifacts. Is the visualization adequate for diagnostic purposes?\"\n\n**Option 4 (If comparing to a known standard):**\n\n\"Compared to a typical presentation of [target anatomical structure], does the upper central region of this 224x224 image demonstrate a good example? Consider the size, shape, and texture of the structure in the primary region of interest, as well as its appearance in the secondary region [describe location].  Also factor in the image quality and resolution in your assessment.\"\n\n\n**Important Note:**  Replace \"[target anatomical structure]\" with the actual anatomical structure of interest (e.g., \"lung nodule,\" \"fracture line,\" \"optic nerve\").  Be as specific as possible.  If known, specify the expected appearance of the structure (e.g., \"well-circumscribed,\" \"hyperechoic\").?",
