  "unified_answer": "The image appears to show a resected heart, with a focus on the opened right atrium and ventricle.  A whitish, irregular mass is visible within the right heart chambers, likely representing a thrombus.  Its exact size is difficult to determine from this image without a scale on the specimen itself, but it appears to involve a significant portion of the right atrium and extends into the right ventricle.  Surrounding structures include the atrial and ventricular walls, which appear somewhat stretched and thinned in areas adjacent to the mass.  The overall appearance suggests a potential right heart obstructive process. Further clinical information and potentially microscopic examination would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.\n",
