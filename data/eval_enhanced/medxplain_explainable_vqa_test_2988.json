It shows a mucosal surface with glandular structures, suggestive of gastrointestinal tract. The upper central portion, which appears to be the area of primary focus, shows the lining epithelium and lamina propria. The other areas of focus appear to be distributed along the mucosal surface, highlighting individual glands and their associated epithelium.\n",
