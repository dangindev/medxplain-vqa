  "reformulated_question": "Based on this 224x224 image, assess the appearance of the infant, focusing on the lower central region (primary focus) and the 59 identified secondary attention regions.  Specifically, evaluate the following for features consistent with a normal, immature infant:\n\n* **Head and Neck:** Evaluate the skull shape and suture lines.  Assess the presence and appearance of the anterior and posterior fontanelles.  Examine the neck for appropriate length and lack of masses.\n* **Chest and Abdomen:**  Assess the rib cage symmetry and the size and shape of the heart and lungs (if visible).  Evaluate the abdominal contour and umbilical cord (if present) for normal appearance.\n* **Spine and Limbs:** Examine the spine for normal curvature.  Assess the limbs for symmetry, appropriate length, and normal joint positioning.\n* **Genitalia:**  If visible, assess for appropriate development based on presumed gestational age.\n* **Overall Appearance:** Comment on the skin appearance (color, texture).  Consider the image quality and any limitations it may impose on the evaluation.  If specific structures are obscured or difficult to visualize due to image quality or infant positioning, note this explicitly.\n\nBased on these observations, determine if the visible anatomical structures within this image are consistent with a normal, immature infant.  Provide specific details supporting your assessment.?",
