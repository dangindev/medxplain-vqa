However, the image lacks definitive features of heart failure cells, such as their characteristic location within alveolar macrophages.  Furthermore, there is no clear evidence of pulmonary congestion like interstitial edema or engorged capillaries.  While the pigment suggests possible previous bleeding, a diagnosis of heart failure cannot be made based on this image alone.\n",
