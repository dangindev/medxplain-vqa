These findings are suggestive of infective endocarditis, likely subacute given the apparent size and lack of overt destructive changes to the valve.  However, a definitive diagnosis requires further clinical information and potentially additional investigations to exclude other causes of valvular abnormalities, such as rheumatic heart disease or nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis.\n",
