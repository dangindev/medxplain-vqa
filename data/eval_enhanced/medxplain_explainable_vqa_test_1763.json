  "unified_answer": "The image displays a mass within parotid gland tissue. A potential capsule is discernible, but its complete nature and regularity are difficult to assess due to the image's limited resolution and field of view.  Areas where the border of the mass appears less distinct suggest possible infiltration into the surrounding parotid tissue. However, definitive confirmation of capsular integrity and invasion requires further evaluation with higher resolution imaging and/or histopathological examination.\n",
