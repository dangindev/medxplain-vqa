Beneath the epithelium (subepithelial), a loose connective tissue layer is visible, appearing pale pink with a slightly fibrillar texture.  Deeper in the section, surrounding what appear to be smooth muscle bundles (perimuscular), there is a similar pale pink, loose connective tissue.  Due to the image resolution and staining, further characterization of cellular components and specific tissue types within these layers is not possible.\n",
