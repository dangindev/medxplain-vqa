There are several other areas of interest as well.  Does this image demonstrate findings consistent with both acute and organized pulmonary infarction, specifically in the upper right lung region? If so, what visual features support this, such as areas of consolidation, wedge-shaped opacities, pleural effusions, or signs of parenchymal remodeling?",
