The evaluation should consider the image resolution and clarity, and if a potential six-digit identifier is partially obscured or ambiguous due to image quality, it should be noted as such.  If anatomical landmarks are used to localize the region of interest further, please specify which landmarks (e.g., \"adjacent to the [anatomical landmark]\").  The six digits should be clearly discernible and distinct from image artifacts or noise.?",
