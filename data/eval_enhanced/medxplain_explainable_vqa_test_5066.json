Specifically, assess the visibility and clarity of structures such as the cerebral hemispheres, sulci, gyri, cerebellum, and brainstem.  Consider the image resolution and the distribution of attention when evaluating the presence and discernibility of these anatomical landmarks.  If specific structures are identifiable, describe their location within the image and their relative size and shape.  If the image quality or resolution limits identification, specify the limitations encountered.?",
