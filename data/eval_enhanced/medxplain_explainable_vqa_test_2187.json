Specifically, examine the middle-right region, considering the image quality and resolution.  If identifiable, describe its location relative to adjacent anatomical landmarks such as the uterus (if visible), fallopian tubes (if visible), and iliac vessels (if visible).  Evaluation criteria include visualization of a structure consistent with the expected size, shape, and texture of an ovary within the given image context.  If the image quality or field of view precludes definitive identification, state that the ovary is not visualized.?",
