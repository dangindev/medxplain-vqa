The lower central region displays the opened endometrial cavity, revealing a hemorrhagic and possibly necrotic appearing endometrium.  The texture is irregular and roughened.  Two rounded structures, likely representing ovaries, are seen laterally. They appear somewhat enlarged and congested.  It is difficult to definitively characterize any specific pathology without further clinical information and microscopic examination.\n",
