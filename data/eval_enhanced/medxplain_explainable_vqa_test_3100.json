Evaluation criteria should include assessment for disruptions in the cortical bone, air-fluid levels within the sphenoid or mastoid air cells, and the presence of any opacification suggestive of hemorrhage in the adjacent soft tissues.  Consider the image quality and resolution when evaluating for subtle findings.  If the image quality limits visualization of these key structures, explicitly state this limitation.?",
