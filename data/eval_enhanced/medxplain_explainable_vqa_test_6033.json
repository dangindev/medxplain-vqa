The upper portion displays the vessel wall, which appears to have a thin, darkly stained lining suggestive of endothelium and a thicker, paler layer consistent with smooth muscle. The lower portion of the image shows connective tissue with scattered cells, possibly fibroblasts. Without further context or special stains, a more precise characterization is difficult.\n",
