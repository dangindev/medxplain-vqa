Specifically, evaluate the lower central region and the eight identified secondary attention regions for deviations from expected anatomical norms in terms of size, shape, density, texture, and position relative to identifiable anatomical landmarks. Consider the image quality and resolution when assessing subtle findings.  If anatomical landmarks are not clearly visible, describe the location of the potential abnormality relative to the image boundaries and other visible structures.  Clearly state the criteria used to determine the presence or absence of an abnormality.?",
