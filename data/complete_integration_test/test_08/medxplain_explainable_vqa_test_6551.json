In the gross images (A and B), the esophageal mucosa appears unremarkable with no obvious masses, strictures, or discolorations.  The microscopic image (C) shows normal esophageal squamous mucosa and underlying submucosa.  No pathological changes are readily apparent in the provided images.  Therefore, a differential diagnosis is not warranted based on the available visual information.\n",
