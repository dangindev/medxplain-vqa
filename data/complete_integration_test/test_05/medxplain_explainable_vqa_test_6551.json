Panel A and B show the gross appearance of the specimen, while Panel C shows a microscopic view, likely a histological section stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).  In Panel C, the mucosa, submucosa, and parts of the muscularis propria are visible. The mucosa appears to have some glandular structures. Without additional clinical information or higher magnification of the histology, a more specific diagnosis or characterization of the tissue is not possible.\n",
