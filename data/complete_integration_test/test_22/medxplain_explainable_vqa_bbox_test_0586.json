While the quality of the image is suboptimal, making definitive assessment challenging, there are linear structures suggestive of fibrosis. These appear as lighter, slightly thicker bands traversing the muscle fibers, particularly in the central and upper portions of the image.  Further evaluation with higher quality imaging would be necessary for a more precise characterization and diagnosis.\n",
