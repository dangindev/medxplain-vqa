The lower central area of focus shows the posterior aspect of the larynx, including the interarytenoid space.  The secondary areas of attention appear to highlight the arytenoid cartilages themselves and the surrounding edematous mucosa.  Specifically, these areas demonstrate swelling and redness consistent with inflammation.\n",
