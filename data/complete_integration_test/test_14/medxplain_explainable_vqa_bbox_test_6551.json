In the gross images (A and B), the mucosal surface appears intact, without obvious ulceration or mass lesions.  The wall appears slightly thickened, but without clear evidence of stricture or obstruction.  The vasculature appears unremarkable. The microscopic image (C) shows normal-appearing mucosa and submucosa. While the image quality and resolution, especially in the gross photos, limit a definitive assessment, no overt abnormalities are readily apparent within the provided views.  Further clinical information and potentially additional imaging or histologic sections would be necessary for a more complete evaluation.\n",
