Other highlighted areas appear to include the esophagus (Panel A and B) and a higher magnification view of what is likely the tracheal wall (Panel C), showing the epithelium, underlying connective tissue, and possibly glands.  The esophagus appears tan and relatively smooth in texture in the gross images (Panels A and B), while the tracheal rings have a more defined, segmented structure.  The microscopic view (Panel C) shows the layered organization of the tracheal wall with varying intensities of pink and purple staining characteristic of hematoxylin and eosin staining.\n",
