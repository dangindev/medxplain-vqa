The lower central portion, along with several other areas, shows linear structures resembling connective tissue or possibly fungal hyphae.  Without higher magnification, special stains, and clinical context, a more specific diagnosis is not possible.  The spatial relationships between the areas of interest are difficult to determine with certainty given the lack of clear anatomical landmarks.\n",
