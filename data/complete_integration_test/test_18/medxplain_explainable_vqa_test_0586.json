The lower central area of focus likely corresponds to an intercalated disc, a specialized cell junction between cardiomyocytes. The four secondary areas of attention could represent other intercalated discs or areas with similar staining intensity, such as dense areas of the cytoskeleton or areas where the tissue section is thicker.  It's difficult to be definitive without more context or higher magnification.\n",
