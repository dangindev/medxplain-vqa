Specifically, several vertically oriented, elongated, pale areas are present, most prominently in the central portion of the image.  These areas are difficult to characterize further due to the image quality, but they contrast with the surrounding darker, more granular appearing tissue.  It is impossible to determine if these represent true anatomical abnormalities without additional information and higher quality imaging.\n",
