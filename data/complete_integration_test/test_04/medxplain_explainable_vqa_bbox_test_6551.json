Panel A and B show the gross appearance of the specimen, with what seems to be mucosal folds and possibly submucosal vasculature visible. Panel C shows a microscopic view, likely of the mucosa, revealing a stratified squamous epithelium characteristic of the esophagus. The underlying lamina propria and possibly submucosa are also visible.  Without further clinical information or scale bars, a more precise identification of the specific segment and any pathological findings is not possible.\n",
