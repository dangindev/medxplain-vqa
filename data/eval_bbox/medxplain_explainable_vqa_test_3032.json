While the villi appear somewhat blunted and the lamina propria contains a mild increase in inflammatory cells, there is no evidence of dilated lacteals filled with foamy macrophages containing PAS-positive material, which is the hallmark of Whipple's disease.  Therefore, the findings in this image are not consistent with Whipple's disease.  No other abnormalities suggestive of Whipple's disease, such as lymphadenopathy or involvement of other organ systems, can be assessed from this image of small bowel mucosa alone.\n",

Do the secondary attention regions demonstrate similar findings or other relevant features like lymphadenopathy or involvement of other organ systems typically affected by Whipple's disease?",
