The nuclei are hyperchromatic (darkly stained) and show some variation in size and shape.  While the architecture is difficult to fully appreciate at this magnification, there appears to be a disorganized arrangement of cells.  These features are concerning for malignancy and further workup, including immunohistochemical stains, would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.\n",
