The surrounding stroma is relatively scant. While the exact focus of the \"attention regions\" is unclear without more precise coordinates, they likely highlight the architectural complexity of the endometrial glands, specifically their irregular shapes and crowding, which are key features in diagnosing endometrial hyperplasia.  The secondary regions may be picking up on variations in gland morphology or areas of stromal condensation.\n",
