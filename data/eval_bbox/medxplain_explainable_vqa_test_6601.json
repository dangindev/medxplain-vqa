  "unified_answer": "The subepithelial layer, located directly beneath the surface epithelium in the upper right quadrant, appears to be composed of loose connective tissue.  It stains a lighter pink compared to the overlying epithelium and the deeper muscle tissue, and has a less dense, more loosely arranged texture.  The perimuscular layer, surrounding the presumed smooth muscle tissue, also appears to be composed of connective tissue.  It exhibits a similar pink hue and loose texture as the subepithelial connective tissue.  Distinguishing these two connective tissue layers based solely on this image is difficult, as their staining and textural characteristics appear very similar.\n",
