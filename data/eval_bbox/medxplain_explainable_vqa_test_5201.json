  "unified_answer": "The provided images show Congo red staining, but they do not demonstrate apple-green birefringence.  While some structures exhibit a reddish-pink hue with this stain, confirming the presence of amyloid requires visualization of apple-green birefringence under polarized light, which is not shown here. Therefore, while the staining suggests the possibility of amyloid, it cannot be definitively confirmed based on these images alone.\n",
