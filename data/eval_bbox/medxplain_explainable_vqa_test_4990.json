The bright yellow-orange to apple-green areas, particularly prominent in the central vessel and surrounding connective tissue, demonstrate birefringence characteristic of amyloid deposits.  The surrounding tissue shows minimal birefringence.  It's important to note that while the image suggests amyloid deposition, a definitive diagnosis requires correlation with other clinical and pathological findings.\n",
