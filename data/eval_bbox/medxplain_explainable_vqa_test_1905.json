Consider the image resolution and any potential artifacts that might mimic numerical characters.  If anatomical structures are obscuring the area of interest, describe the obstructing anatomy using relevant anatomical landmarks.  The evaluation criteria for a positive identification requires six distinct, contiguous digits that are clearly distinguishable from surrounding image noise or anatomical features.?",
