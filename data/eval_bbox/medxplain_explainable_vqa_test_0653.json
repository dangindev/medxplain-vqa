No recognizable anatomical structures such as spines, rib cages, skulls, limbs, or internal organs are identifiable at this magnification and resolution.  Therefore, it is not possible to assess for duplicated or shared anatomy suggestive of conjoined twins.\n",

Consider image quality and resolution limitations when assessing for subtle anatomical variations and connections.  Describe the location of any potential shared structures relative to other anatomical landmarks present.  Specifically, if any potential duplication is observed, describe the nature of the connection between the two individuals (e.g., location and extent of shared tissue).?",
