Specifically, examine the middle-right region of the image, considering the image quality and resolution.  If applicable, use anatomical landmarks such as the uterus, fallopian tubes, or iliac vessels to aid in localization.  The evaluation criteria for a positive identification should include visualization of an ovoid structure consistent with ovarian morphology in the expected anatomical location.  If the image quality or field of view precludes definitive identification, state that the ovary is not visualized.?",
