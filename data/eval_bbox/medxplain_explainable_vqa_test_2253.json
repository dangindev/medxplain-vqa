The fallopian tubes and ovaries are also not present in this image.  The image quality is adequate to identify the uterine tissue, but the surrounding anatomical context, including bladder and rectum, is not visible, making definitive spatial orientation challenging.  The cut surface of the uterus reveals what appears to be a submucosal fibroid.\n",

Evaluation should consider the image quality and resolution, and if visible, utilize anatomical landmarks such as the bladder (anterior to the uterus) and rectum (posterior to the uterus) for spatial context.  Specifically describe the visibility and characteristics of any identified structures, noting any limitations imposed by the image quality or field of view. If structures are not clearly visualized, explain why based on the image characteristics.?",
