Scattered throughout the section are eosinophils and what appear to be cross-sections of small blood vessels.  The overall appearance is consistent with chronic inflammation. While there are subtle variations in cellular density throughout the image, there isn't a clearly defined primary focus in the upper left quadrant that is dramatically different from the rest of the tissue.  The distribution of inflammatory cells appears relatively uniform.\n",
