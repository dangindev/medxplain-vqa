The question regarding talc pleurodesis, pleural thickening, or calcification is irrelevant as this is a liver biopsy, not a chest image.  There are no radiographic findings to assess as this is viewed under a microscope, not with x-ray.  The question of emphysema and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is also not pertinent to this image.\n",
