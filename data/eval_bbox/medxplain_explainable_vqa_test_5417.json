The image quality is sufficient to assess the dentition but inadequate for detailed assessment of other oral structures.\n",

Specifically, assess the image quality in the lower left quadrant and describe the visibility and clarity of these anatomical landmarks.  If these structures are identifiable and adequately visualized, consider the oral cavity \"present.\" If obscured by artifacts, poor resolution, or out of the field of view, consider it \"not present.\"  Note any secondary attention regions and their potential impact on the evaluation of the primary region of interest.?",
