Within the glomerulus, there are several cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei. While some of these nuclei show margination of chromatin, they do not exhibit the classic \"owl's eye\" inclusions characteristic of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.  There is no definitive evidence of tissue edema, necrosis, or inflammation directly attributable to CMV.  Given the image resolution and the absence of specific viral cytopathic effects, I am confident that this image does not show definitive features of CMV infection.\n",

Specifically, examine the primary focus region and the six secondary regions of interest for signs such as  [mention specific CMV-related image findings e.g.,  \"owl's eye inclusions,\" tissue edema, areas of inflammation/necrosis, periventricular calcifications (if brain imaging),  retinal changes (if eye imaging), etc.].  Consider the image resolution and any artifacts that might confound interpretation.  Describe the anatomical location of any suspected findings using relevant anatomical landmarks.  For example, if the image depicts lung tissue, describe the location relative to the bronchi, vessels, or lobes.  If the image depicts brain tissue, describe the location relative to ventricles, sulci, or gyri.  Provide a confidence level for the presence or absence of CMV-related findings based on the available visual information.?",
