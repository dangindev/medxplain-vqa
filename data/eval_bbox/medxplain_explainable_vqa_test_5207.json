While the appearance is suggestive of an intraepithelial blistering process, definitive features of pemphigus vulgaris, such as flaccid bullae, erosions, or crusting, are not readily apparent in this particular view.  A broader view and clinical correlation would be necessary for a more conclusive diagnosis.\n",
