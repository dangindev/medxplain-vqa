The tissue appears relatively uniform with expected eosinophilic staining of the cardiomyocytes.  While there is some variation in fiber size and interstitial spacing, these are within the normal range of variation and do not suggest specific pathology based on this image alone.  Further clinical information and potentially additional stains would be needed for a definitive diagnosis.\n",
