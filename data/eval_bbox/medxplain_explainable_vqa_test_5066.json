Consider image quality and resolution when evaluating the clarity and discernibility of these structures.  If identifiable, are any major landmarks such as the longitudinal fissure, central sulcus, or Sylvian fissure visible?  The evaluation should consider the expected appearance of these structures given the image's resolution and potential imaging modality.?",
