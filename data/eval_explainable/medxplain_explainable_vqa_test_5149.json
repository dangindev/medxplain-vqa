Whitish areas, possibly representing thrombus or fibrosis, are visible within the ventricular cavity.  The overall appearance suggests significant pathology, potentially related to a cardiac event such as an infarction.  Further clinical information and potentially microscopic examination would be needed for a definitive diagnosis.\n",
