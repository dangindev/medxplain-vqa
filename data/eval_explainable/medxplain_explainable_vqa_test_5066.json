No recognizable brain structures such as gyri, sulci, or ventricles are present.\n",

Specifically, assess the middle-right region and the 16 secondary regions of interest for the presence of identifiable anatomical landmarks such as gyri, sulci, ventricles, or other characteristic brain structures. Consider the image quality and resolution when evaluating the visibility and clarity of these structures.  The evaluation should determine if sufficient anatomical detail is present to confidently confirm the presence of brain tissue, even if the entire brain is not fully visualized.?",
