Specifically, examine the lung fields, including the hila and mediastinum, for the presence of nodules, masses, or irregular opacities.  Consider the image resolution and any artifacts that might mimic pathology.  Evaluate the relationship of any identified abnormalities to the vasculature, airways, and pleura.  Describe the size, shape, margin characteristics, and attenuation of any suspicious findings.  Also, assess for pleural effusions or lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and hila.?",
