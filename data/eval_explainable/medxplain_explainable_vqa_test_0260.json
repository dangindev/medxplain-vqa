It is not an image of the abdomen and does not show any abdominal structures such as the rectus abdominis, external obliques, liver, stomach, or intestines.  The costal margin and iliac crests are also not visible. The field of view is significantly too small and at too high a magnification to visualize any gross anatomical structures.\n",

Assess the visibility of these structures based on image quality and contrast. If the inferior costal margin and iliac crests are visible, use them as landmarks to define the superior and inferior boundaries of the abdomen, respectively.  Note any limitations imposed by the field of view.?",
