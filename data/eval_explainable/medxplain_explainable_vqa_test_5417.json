The retromolar trigone is not clearly discernible in this image.  Portions of the hard palate are visible.  Due to the image's resolution and angle, the soft palate is not clearly visualized.\n",

Specifically, assess the lower left region for the presence of the following structures: tongue, floor of mouth, mandibular alveolar ridge, and retromolar trigone.  Consider the image quality and resolution when evaluating for these structures.  If the tongue is visible, note its position relative to the floor of the mouth and mandibular teeth (if present).  Secondary attention regions should also be examined for possible portions of the oral cavity, including the hard palate and soft palate.  Presence should be confirmed only if anatomical landmarks are clearly discernible and distinguishable from surrounding tissues.?",
