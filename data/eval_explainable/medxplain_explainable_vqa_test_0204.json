The mass exhibits a variegated appearance with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis intermixed with paler, potentially viable tumor tissue.  It appears to be several centimeters in diameter, occupying a significant portion of the liver section.  The surrounding liver parenchyma appears congested.  The differential diagnosis for such a lesion includes hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma, and metastatic disease, though further workup including microscopy is required for a definitive diagnosis.\n",
