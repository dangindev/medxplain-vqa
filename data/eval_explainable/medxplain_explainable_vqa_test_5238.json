The infiltrate extends up to the dermal-epidermal junction.  While there appears to be some variation in cellular density within the infiltrate, the overall morphology appears similar throughout the dermis depicted in this image section.  Without further clinical information or special stains, a more specific diagnosis is not possible based on this image alone.\n",
