The other highlighted areas throughout the image appear to select similar areas of increased cellularity and density, often adjacent to paler, less cellular regions.  These areas vary in size and shape, ranging from small, focal collections to larger, more irregular zones.  The intensity of the staining in these areas appears darker overall compared to the surrounding tissue.  Without further clinical information or special stains, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made from this image alone.\n",
