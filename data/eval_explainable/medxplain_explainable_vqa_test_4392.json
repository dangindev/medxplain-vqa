There are no structures resembling capillaries, nor are there any microorganisms identifiable as mycobacteria.  The overall appearance is suggestive of a spindle cell neoplasm, but further workup including immunohistochemical stains would be required for a definitive diagnosis.  Special stains for acid-fast bacilli are not indicated based on this image alone.\n",
