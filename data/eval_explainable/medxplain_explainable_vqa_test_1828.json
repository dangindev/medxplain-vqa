The distributed attention likely reflects the variation in cellularity and tissue architecture throughout the sample.  The image appears to show a relatively homogenous pink area centrally, which transitions to a paler, less dense area towards the bottom.  There is also a suggestion of a more organized, possibly fibrous or capsular, structure at the very top.  Without further clinical information or special stains, a more specific diagnosis is not possible.\n",
