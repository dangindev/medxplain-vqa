It appears as a relatively clear, irregular space surrounded by a ring of purplish-pink acinar cells. These cells have granular cytoplasm and distinct, albeit small, nuclei. Surrounding the acinus are other acini and connective tissue elements. The acinar cells are arranged in clusters, creating a dense, lobular pattern.  Some small blood vessels are also visible within the connective tissue, appearing as smaller, clear spaces lined by flattened endothelial cells.\n",
