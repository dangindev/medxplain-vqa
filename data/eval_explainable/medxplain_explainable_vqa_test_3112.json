In the top image, which shows a cross-section of the heart, the thrombi occupy a significant portion of the apical regions of both ventricles and appear to be in contact with the endocardial surface and the respective ventricular walls.  The lower image, demonstrating the opened heart, confirms the apical location and shows the thrombi adjacent to the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae.\n",
