It's a pale pink, relatively homogenous area with a slightly fibrillar texture.  The perimuscular layer, surrounding the smooth muscle bundles in the right image, also appears to be composed of loose connective tissue with a similar pale pink color and fibrillar texture.  Small blood vessels, appearing as thin, dark pink, elongated structures, are present within both layers.  No significant inflammatory infiltrate or other unusual features are readily apparent within these layers.\n",
