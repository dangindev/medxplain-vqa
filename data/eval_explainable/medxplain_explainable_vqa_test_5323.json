The peripheral zone surrounding the more densely packed acini contains more loosely arranged cells and what appears to be connective tissue.  There's a clear structural difference between the central, acinar-rich zone and the more dispersed peripheral arrangement.  The peripheral cells appear smaller and less organized than those in the central acini.\n",
