Some exhibit open capillary loops, while others appear more solid.  The tubules are generally less dense than the glomeruli and have irregular, often elongated shapes.  There are also areas of interstitial tissue visible, appearing less dense and more amorphous than the glomeruli and tubules.  Overall, the tissue architecture appears somewhat disrupted.  Further clinical information and higher magnification would be necessary for a more specific diagnosis.\n",
