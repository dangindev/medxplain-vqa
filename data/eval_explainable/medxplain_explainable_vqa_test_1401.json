The upper left fragment shows a predominantly tan-pink cut surface with a focal area of dark red discoloration, suggestive of hemorrhage or congestion. The other fragments show similar tan-pink tissue with varying degrees of the same dark red discoloration.  Without further clinical information or microscopic examination, a definitive diagnosis is not possible. However, the gross appearance is consistent with a process involving vascular congestion or hemorrhage, and the differential diagnosis would include possibilities such as infarction, trauma, or a vascular lesion.  Further workup, including microscopy, would be required for a definitive diagnosis.\n",
