A post-mortem radiograph would not differ significantly in appearance from an antemortem radiograph unless there were post-mortem changes to the bone such as fractures or decompositional changes. The question of \"gross\" findings cannot be answered from a radiograph, as this refers to macroscopic examination of the lesion itself, not an image of it.\n",
