The lungs exhibit multifocal, dark red to black discolorations suggestive of hemorrhage or congestion.  The intestines are also visible, and there appears to be dark, possibly hemorrhagic or necrotic, tissue along the mesentery.  The overall appearance suggests a severe systemic disease process.  Further information regarding the species, history, and other findings would be needed for a more specific diagnosis.\n",
