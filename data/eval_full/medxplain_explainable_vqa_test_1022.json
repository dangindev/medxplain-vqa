  "reformulated_question": "**Option 1 (Focus on clarity and specific region):**\n\n\"In the upper central region of this 224x224 image, is there a clearly visualized example of [target anatomical structure]?  The image appears to have distributed attention, so please assess the quality of visualization specifically in this primary focus area.  Consider [relevant anatomical landmark] for spatial context.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Focus on comparison with secondary region):**\n\n\"This 224x224 image exhibits distributed attention with a primary focus in the upper center and a secondary region of attention.  Comparing these two regions, is a good example of [target anatomical structure] better visualized in the primary (upper center) region?  Evaluate the clarity and definition of the structure in both areas, considering [relevant anatomical landmark] for anatomical context.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Focus on image quality limitations):**\n\n\"Given the distributed attention and 224x224 resolution of this image, is the visualization of [target anatomical structure] in the upper central region sufficient to serve as a good example?  Specifically, assess the impact of the image quality on the ability to clearly identify [specific features of the target structure] in relation to [relevant anatomical landmark].\"\n\n**Example using Option 1 with specific anatomical details:**\n\n\"In the upper central region of this 224x224 image, is there a clearly visualized example of the supraspinatus tendon? The image appears to have distributed attention, so please assess the quality of visualization specifically in this primary focus area. Consider the acromion process for spatial context.\"\n\n\n**Key improvements in the reformulated questions:**\n\n* **Specificity:**  Instead of \"very good example,\" we ask about a specific anatomical structure.\n* **Image context:** We reference the image dimensions and the distributed attention.\n* **Anatomical context:** We include relevant anatomical landmarks to provide spatial context.\n* **Clear criteria:** We specify what to look for (clarity, definition, specific features) and where to look (upper central region, secondary region).\n\n\nRemember to replace the bracketed placeholders ([...]) with the actual anatomical structure, features, and landmarks relevant to the specific image.?",
