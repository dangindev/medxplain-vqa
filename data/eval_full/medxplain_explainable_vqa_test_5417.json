Specifically, assess the lower left quadrant for the presence of the following structures: tongue, floor of mouth, mandibular alveolar ridge, and retromolar trigone.  Secondary attention regions should be examined for portions of the hard palate, soft palate, and uvula.  Consider image quality and resolution when evaluating the visibility and clarity of these structures.  If these anatomical landmarks are discernible and their morphology is adequately represented, then consider the oral cavity \"present\".  If the image quality precludes adequate visualization or the expected anatomical structures are not clearly depicted within the regions of interest, then consider the oral cavity \"not present\".?",
