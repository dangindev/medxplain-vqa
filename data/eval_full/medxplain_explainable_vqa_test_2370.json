Specifically, examine the lung fields, including the hila and mediastinum, for the presence of nodules, masses, or other abnormalities such as pleural effusions or lymphadenopathy.  Consider the image resolution and any artifacts that might confound interpretation.  Evaluate the visibility of key anatomical landmarks such as the ribs, clavicles, and diaphragm to ensure proper anatomical localization of any potential findings.  Describe the characteristics of any identified abnormalities, including size, shape, margins, and attenuation, to support the assessment for metastatic disease.?",
