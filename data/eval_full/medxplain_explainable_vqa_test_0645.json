The lower central area, and other scattered regions throughout the image, demonstrate enlarged airspaces, consistent with alveolar destruction.  While the provided heatmap highlights several areas, the low resolution and lack of clinical context make it difficult to definitively characterize the five secondary regions beyond noting they also appear to contain areas of emphysematous change similar to the central region. Further information, including staining technique and magnification, would be necessary for a more precise diagnosis.\n",
