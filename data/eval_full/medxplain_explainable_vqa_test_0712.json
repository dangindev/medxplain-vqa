Specifically, assess the image quality for adequate visualization of these structures.  If the heart is visible, comment on its size, shape, and position relative to mediastinal structures (if visible).  If great vessels are visible, comment on their caliber and course.  Note any abnormalities in appearance, size, or position of these structures.  If the image quality or field of view is insufficient to assess these features, please state that explicitly.?",
