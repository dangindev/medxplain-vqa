Specifically, evaluate the visibility and clarity of [Specific anatomical landmarks relevant to the target structure(s), e.g., tracheal bifurcation, aortic knob, portal vein confluence].  Consider the image quality, including resolution and contrast, in your assessment.  Describe the appearance of the [target structure(s)] including [Specific visual characteristics to look for, e.g., shape, size, texture, density/intensity].  If the [target structure(s)] is/are present, describe its/their location relative to [Adjacent anatomical landmarks, e.g., the heart, the liver, the diaphragm]. If the [target structure(s)] is/are not clearly visualized, explain the possible reasons based on the image characteristics.?",
