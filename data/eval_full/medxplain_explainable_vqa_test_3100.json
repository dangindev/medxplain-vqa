While the skull base is visible, the image quality and resolution are insufficient to definitively assess for subtle fractures.  No obvious discontinuities, displacements, or lucencies of the clivus, sphenoid, petrous temporal bones, or occipital bone around the foramen magnum are readily apparent.  However, a more detailed evaluation with higher resolution imaging would be necessary to exclude small fractures.\n",

Evaluation criteria include assessing for disruptions in the cortical bone continuity, such as lucencies, step-offs, or displacement.  Consider the image quality and resolution when evaluating for subtle findings.  Note any secondary attention regions and their relationship to the skull base.?",
