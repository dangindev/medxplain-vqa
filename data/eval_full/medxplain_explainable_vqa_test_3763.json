There is no evidence of a pneumonic process, viral or otherwise, as this is not a chest radiograph but a microscopic image of a lymph node.  Therefore, influenza cannot be implicated based on this image.  Further clinical correlation and potentially additional studies would be needed to determine the cause of the lymphadenitis.\n",
