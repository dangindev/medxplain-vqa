  "reformulated_question": "Based on this 224x224 image with distributed attention, primarily in the upper right quadrant, and three secondary attention regions, assess the visual evidence for respiratory effort. Specifically, examine the visibility and motion of the following:\n\n1. **Rib cage:** Evaluate the clarity of the rib contours, particularly in the upper right quadrant.  Are the ribs clearly defined, or obscured by artifacts or low image quality?  Look for any evidence of rib expansion and contraction, comparing the rib spacing between the primary and secondary attention regions.\n\n2. **Diaphragm:** If visible, assess the position and contour of the diaphragm.  Describe its shape (e.g., domed, flattened) and position relative to adjacent structures such as the liver and lungs.  Look for any changes in diaphragmatic position between different regions of interest or across sequential images (if available).\n\n3. **Lungs:** Evaluate the lung fields for evidence of aeration and expansion.  Describe the lung markings and overall radiopacity.  If motion is discernible, describe the extent of lung expansion and any asymmetry between the left and right lungs.\n\n4. **Airway:** If the airway is visible, assess its patency.  Note any areas of narrowing or obstruction.\n\nConsidering the image dimensions and distributed attention, explicitly state whether the image quality and anatomical detail are sufficient to confidently assess respiratory effort.  If not, specify the limitations.?",
