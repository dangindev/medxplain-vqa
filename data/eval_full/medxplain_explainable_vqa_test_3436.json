The surface appears irregular with multiple, variably sized, pale tan to slightly yellow nodules and depressions scattered across it.  The overall shape of the spleen is preserved, though the surface irregularities disrupt its smooth contour. A ruler is present, indicating the organ's size. Without further clinical information, it is impossible to determine the underlying cause of these observed changes.\n",
