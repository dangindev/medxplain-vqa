Specifically, examine the upper left region of interest and the seven secondary attention regions for evidence of the following, considering the image resolution and clarity:\n\n* **Pituitary gland:** Assess for the presence and normal appearance of the pituitary gland in relation to the sella turcica.\n* **Thyroid gland:** Evaluate for the presence, size, and shape of the thyroid gland, noting its relationship to the trachea and surrounding structures.\n* **Parathyroid glands:** If visible, assess the location and appearance of the parathyroid glands in relation to the thyroid gland.\n* **Adrenal glands:** Examine the superior poles of the kidneys for the presence and shape of the adrenal glands.\n* **Pancreas:** Evaluate the region for the presence and normal appearance of the pancreas, noting its relationship to the duodenum and spleen.\n* **Pineal gland:** If visible, assess the location and appearance of the pineal gland.\n* **Gonads (testes/ovaries):** If the image includes the relevant anatomy, assess for the presence and normal appearance of the testes or ovaries.\n* **Other endocrine tissues:** Look for any other potential endocrine tissues based on their expected location and appearance within the imaged anatomy.\n\nDescribe the visual characteristics of any identified endocrine structures, including size, shape, and any apparent abnormalities.  Note any limitations imposed by the image quality or field of view that prevent a complete assessment.?",
