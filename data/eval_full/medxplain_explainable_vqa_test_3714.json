Specifically, examine the endocervical canal and the surrounding ectocervix.  Look for a smooth, pedunculated or sessile lesion protruding from the endocervical canal.  Consider the image quality and resolution when evaluating for subtle features such as vascularity or surface texture of any identified protrusion.  Note the location of the external os and the relationship of any potential polyp to this landmark.  If a suspected polyp is identified, describe its size, shape, and location relative to the external os and other visible endocervical structures. If the image quality is insufficient to definitively identify a polyp, please state so explicitly.?",
