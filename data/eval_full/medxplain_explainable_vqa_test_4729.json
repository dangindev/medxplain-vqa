Scattered throughout the field are larger, eosinophilic structures, possibly blood vessels or other tissue elements.  Without additional clinical information or special stains, a more specific diagnosis is not possible.  The overall texture appears somewhat disorganized, and there is no obvious architectural pattern or specific lesion readily identifiable.\n",
