While some cells appear larger than others, there is no definitive evidence of Reed-Sternberg cells or lacunar cells.  The overall appearance is not specifically diagnostic for nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. Further workup, including immunohistochemical staining, would be required for a definitive diagnosis.\n",
