In the subepithelial area, there are numerous glands lined by a single layer of cuboidal to columnar epithelium.  The perimuscular region appears to contain looser connective tissue with interspersed blood vessels.  However, without additional information regarding the specific tissue type, stain used, and higher magnification, a more precise characterization of the cellularity, density, and specific structures within these layers is not possible.\n",
