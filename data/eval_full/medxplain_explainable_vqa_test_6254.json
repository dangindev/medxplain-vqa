The differential diagnosis is broad and includes inflammatory conditions like colitis (if this is colon) or gastritis (if stomach), or possibly a neoplastic process with an associated inflammatory response.  Further workup, including clinical correlation and potentially immunohistochemical stains, is required for a definitive diagnosis.  The location of the biopsy and patient history are essential for accurate interpretation.\n",
