  "unified_answer": "This heart displays multiple small, dark red, irregular deposits, most prominently on the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae of the mitral valve.  This appearance is consistent with subacute bacterial endocarditis.  However, other conditions could present similarly and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. These include rheumatic heart disease,  nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (marantic endocarditis), and systemic lupus erythematosus with Libman-Sacks endocarditis.  Further workup including blood cultures, a complete history and physical examination, and possibly additional imaging studies would be required for a definitive diagnosis.\n",
