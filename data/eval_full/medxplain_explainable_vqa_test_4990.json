The right image likely demonstrates the appearance under polarized light. While Congo red staining is used to detect amyloid deposits, which exhibit apple-green birefringence under polarized light, the image provided does not clearly demonstrate this characteristic.  Therefore, the presence of amyloid cannot be confirmed based on this image alone. Further information about the staining and imaging techniques used is needed for a definitive diagnosis.\n",

Describe these characteristics specifically for each region.?",
